ESP32 Water Level Display (7-Seg) 


To measure the water tank level using an ESP32 and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and display it on a seven-segment display as a percentage, you can follow these steps:

Hardware Setup:

Connect the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to the ESP32 as follows:

VCC to 5V (or 3.3V if your sensor supports it)
GND to GND
TRIG to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO_TRIGGER)
ECHO to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO_ECHO)
Connect a common-anode or common-cathode 3-digit seven-segment display to the ESP32 using appropriate driver ICs or libraries. Make sure to connect the segment pins and digit pins properly.

Software Implementation:

Install the necessary libraries for your ESP32 board, such as the Arduino IDE and the ESP32 library.

Write the code to measure the water tank level using the HC-SR04 sensor and calculate the percentage. Here's a basic example using the Arduino framework:

In this code:

Replace TRIGGER_PIN and ECHO_PIN with the GPIO pins you've connected the HC-SR04 to.
Adjust tankHeight to match the height of your water tank in centimeters.
Make sure to specify the correct pin numbers in SevSeg sevseg.begin() for your seven-segment display.
Upload this code to your ESP32, and it should measure the water tank level and display it as a percentage on the seven-segment display. Adjust the code and hardware connections as needed for your specific setup.
